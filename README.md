## How to use CensusDis, the friendliest Python API for U.S. Census Data

This is a repo for [a workshop](https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/index.html#1056) presented at the 2025 NICAR confernece.


## Installation
This repo uses Python 3.11.8 but should work for most any version 3.0+. It uses the built-in `venv` module for virtual environments. To install, clone the repo and run the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API KEY
You'll need an API key from the U.S. Census Bureau to use this package. You can get one [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).
